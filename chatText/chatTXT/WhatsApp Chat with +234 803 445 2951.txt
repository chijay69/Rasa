CrusaderSterling Pensions: Good morning, sir.
CrusaderSterling Pensions: Please confirm the office you submitted.
+234 803 445 2951: I am surprised about this question you asked me. I submitted to you directly and you promised that l will get reply last Friday. Three of you at that reception desk. You the fair lady at the 3rd desk. Please you have all my documents. You even asked me to send you message while in your office to confirm the number you gave to me. I don't know your name but you are fair in complexion. I can identify you any day any time.
+234 803 445 2951: Check the documents l submitted to you on Monday last. NKERE CHUKWUEMEKA, AEROMARITIME NIG LIMITED.
+234 803 445 2951: Please confirm processing of my pension has commenced? Expecting your urgent reply.
+234 803 445 2951: You gave me form to go to High Court and l went they stamped and signed. You gave me for my Bank to sign and stamp and l did. I asked for your WhatsApp number, you gave me this number and now you are asking me who I submitted to. This your question is too annoying.
+234 803 445 2951: Please check the documents you collected on 19/6/2023.
+234 803 445 2951: Madam you will check my NIN whether it tallies with my date of birth. These are discussions l had with you that day as evidence.
+234 803 445 2951: ... you said you will...
+234 803 445 2951: <Media omitted>
+234 803 445 2951: Missed voice call
+234 803 445 2951: Good morning, please l am tired of waiting for PENCOM'S platform. That cannot be an excuse to withhold my money. I will be there on Friday to collect my money or you people will kill me .
CrusaderSterling Pensions: Good afternoon.
CrusaderSterling Pensions: We hope network is restored this week, sir.
CrusaderSterling Pensions: Please bear with us.
+234 803 445 2951: Please, l want to confirm if l can come for my money. That's if the PENCOM's platform has been restored.
CrusaderSterling Pensions: Good morning.
CrusaderSterling Pensions: The platform is not yet restored.
+234 803 445 2951: Then you people should be ready to kill me any day l come. It is most ridiculous not to give me my money simply because you want to find out if my date of birth correspond with NIN. So we no longer have Engineers in Nigeria.
CrusaderSterling Pensions: Sir, we really understand. We are aggressively following up with PENCOM for the system to be resolved.
+234 803 445 2951: Good afternoon, please the 21 days l supposed to collect my money has passed having submitted all the documents requested by you on the 19th of June 2023. I hope l can now come? Thank you.
